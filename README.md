# Pipeline

## A full-stack web-app for customer relationship management.

Our tool is a simple Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) for managing contacts with leads and clients. It allows you to define workflows (called “strategies”) and apply them to different clients. The clients will then be assigned in to-do lists to salespeople, following the logic you define in your workflow.

For example, say you sell refrigerators. You might receive leads through your website--people leave their name and contact info because they want more information. You can then add this information to a workflow in our CRM, and the lead will be assigned to a salesperson. If the person needs to interpret a lot of information to make their purchasing decision, you might follow the call up with an e-mail, then call again one week later to see if they have made a decision.

### Getting started

If you would like to set up a Pipeline for your company, there are a few things that you must take into consideration. Firstly, a supervisor or manager should set up a company account, which means including all the relevant company details when signing up. Then, an admin account will be created, through which one can define strategies, add leads and assign them to company agents. Please note that the admin account must add agents and supervisors as well. Each of these accounts, added by the admin, will be generated with a default password of `test1234`. Each agent and supervisor should change this password when they first log in. 

An agent will only be able to see the leads and actions assigned to them. They can update the actions for each lead and the tables will update dynamically to show the next action. But they won't be able to edit or delete any leads.

A supervisor can add new agents and give them leads. They may also define multiple strategies--perhaps your company has a few different ones. 

### About the project

Pipeline was built for Tec de Monterrey's full-stack web development bootcamp. The project required React.js, Node.js, Express.js and a Sequelize ORM (connected to a mySQL database) to meet the grading criteria. It also required clean code and clean design. 

Pipeline was built by [Edgar Burelo](https://github.com/EdgarBurelo), [Claudia Taylor](https://github.com/claudiact6) and [Raghava Lakshminarayana](https://github.com/raglaks). All team members participated in both back-end and front-end aspects of the project. Tasks were organized beforehand and delegated through the Github project manager and Slack.

### Final thoughts

This was a very ambitious project given the fact that all three team members were complete JavaScript newbies six months prior. Edgar and Claudia's sales and business backgrounds coincided when coming up with Pipeline. Our goal was to build an easy-to-use Customer Relationship Manager that didn't cost a fortune. The current version is a solid MVP that is fully-functional. Obviously, because of time-concerns, a lot of the features--especially UX-wise--can be improved. But because we wanted to deliver a complete web-app, most of our energy was spent on building a robust back-end and a clean front-end. 

We have listed quite a few features in a "nice-to-haves" column, in our [Github project board](https://github.com/EdgarBurelo/finalProject/projects/1). Perhaps you'll see a few of them in Pipeline 2.0.
